#### tidyData.txt columns/values:

For a detailed explanation of how the tidyData.txt data was extracted and processed, please refer to the README.md document available in this repository.

tidyData.txt is composed of 180 rows/observations and 68 columns/values.

The following column names were kept from the original data source except for "activity" and "subject", and the values represent the means of the original data grouped by "activity" and "subject".

##### Column name: "activity"
- Column number: 1
- Column type: Factor
- Values: "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS" ,"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING"

##### Column name: "subject"
- Column number: 2
- Column type: Factor
- Values: 30 subjects enumerated from "1" to "30"

##### Column name: "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" to "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"
- Column number: 3 to 68
- Column type: Numeric
- Values: Mean value of column grouped by "activity" and "subject"
- Units: Every original variable has been normalised into a -1 to 1 range, so the units are meaningless.
- Complete column names (1) (2):
  - "tBodyAcc-mean()-X", "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y", "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"
  - "tBodyAcc-std()-X", "tBodyAcc-std()-Y", "tBodyAcc-std()-Z"
  - "tGravityAcc-mean()-X", "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y", "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z"
  - "tGravityAcc-std()-X", "tGravityAcc-std()-Y", "tGravityAcc-std()-Z"
  - "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X", "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y", "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" 
  - "tBodyAccJerk-std()-X", "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y", "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" 
  - "tBodyGyro-mean()-X", "tBodyGyro-mean()-Y", "tBodyGyro-mean()-Z" 
  - "tBodyGyro-std()-X", "tBodyGyro-std()-Y", "tBodyGyro-std()-Z" 
  - "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X", "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y", "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z" 
  - "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X", "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y", "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z" 
  - "tBodyAccMag-mean()", "tBodyAccMag-std()", "tGravityAccMag-mean()" 
  - "tGravityAccMag-std()", "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()", "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()" 
  - "tBodyGyroMag-mean()", "tBodyGyroMag-std()", "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" 
  - "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"
  - "fBodyAcc-mean()-X", "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y", "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z" 
  - "fBodyAcc-std()-X", "fBodyAcc-std()-Y", "fBodyAcc-std()-Z" 
  - "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X", "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y", "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" 
  - "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X", "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y", "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" 
  - "fBodyGyro-mean()-X", "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y", "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z" 
  - "fBodyGyro-std()-X", "fBodyGyro-std()-Y", "fBodyGyro-std()-Z" 
  - "fBodyAccMag-mean()", "fBodyAccMag-std()", "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" 
  - "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()", "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()" 
  - "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"

(1) The "t" and "f" prefix of the column names specifies if the values were calculated
from the time or frequency domain.
(2) Only column names containing "std()" and "mean()" have been kept, following the assignment requirements.
